# Assign DDP on a single GPU (useful for testing)

# Strategy
accelerator: gpu
devices: 1
num_nodes: 1

strategy: ddp # ddp, ddp_spawn, etc. 

# Modes
# use_distributed_sampler: # If `False` then provide your own `DistibutedSampler` in the returned `DataLoader`
sync_batchnorm: True # Sync batch norm statistics across processes (slow but useful is small batch size per device)
